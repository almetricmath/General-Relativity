This project provides python code to go 
along with the Relativity writeups
There are driver programs for 2nd, 3rd, and fourth order tensors
Each order tensor has a driver program that computes the tensor by 
outer product and inner product. It also changes the coordinate system 
and computes the outer product and inner product formulations of a tensor
in the primed coordinate system. There are also drivers to test all the 
configurations - raising and lowering all the indices using the metric and
inverse metric in both the unprimed and primed coordinate systems.

The output of the python code is in a latex format compatible with MS Word - 
See (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8). 
The latex used in MS Word is not standard latex. 

The program has been run in ubuntu linux and on a Windows terminal - see ( https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=us&rtc=1). There are subscripts and superscripts that work in these two programs.
In the Windows command prompt, some of the subscripts and superscipts don't render properly.
