This project provides code to go 
along with the Relativity writeups
There are driver programs for 2nd, 3rd, and fourth order tensors
Each order tensor has a driver program that computes the tensor by 
outer product and inner product. It also changes the coordinate system 
and computes the outer product and inner product formulations of a tensor
in the primed coordinate system. There are also drivers to test all the 
configurations - raising and lowering all the indices using the metric and
inverse metric in both the unprimed and primed coordinate systems.
